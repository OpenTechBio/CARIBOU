        "\n",
        "2. **Quality Control (QC) Metrics Calculation**: Calculate standard QC metrics and generate informative plots to assess data quality. This is handled by the `QC_metrics_agent`.\n",

        "3. **Doublet Detection and Filtering**: Identify potential doublets and filter them from the dataset. This is handled by the `doublet_agent`.\n",

        "8. **Cell Type Annotation**: Annotate cell types using a specified model or custom marker gene sets. This is handled by the `Celltyping_agent`.\n",
